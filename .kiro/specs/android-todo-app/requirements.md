# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A fully functional Android Todo application built with modern Android development stack (Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Room, Kotlin Coroutines/Flow). The app provides offline-first CRUD operations with immediate UI updates, modular architecture, and comprehensive testing. The application supports task management with search, filtering, due dates, and settings persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all my todo items in a list so that I can see what tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a list of all todo items
2. WHEN a todo item is marked as done THEN the system SHALL visually indicate its completed status
3. WHEN there are no todo items THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message
4. WHEN the list is refreshed THEN the system SHALL show the most current data from local storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and edit todo items so that I can manage my tasks effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I tap the add button THEN the system SHALL navigate to an edit screen for creating a new todo
2. WHEN I tap on an existing todo item THEN the system SHALL navigate to an edit screen with pre-filled data
3. WHEN I save a todo item THEN the system SHALL persist it to local storage and return to the list
4. WHEN I set a due date THEN the system SHALL store and display the date appropriately
5. WHEN I cancel editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and return to the list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter my todo items so that I can quickly find specific tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the search field THEN the system SHALL filter todos by title and note content
2. WHEN I select "All" filter THEN the system SHALL show all todo items
3. WHEN I select "Active" filter THEN the system SHALL show only incomplete todos
4. WHEN I select "Done" filter THEN the system SHALL show only completed todos
5. WHEN search or filter is applied THEN the system SHALL update the list immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly complete or delete todo items using swipe gestures so that I can efficiently manage my tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I swipe right on a todo item THEN the system SHALL mark it as completed
2. WHEN I swipe left on a todo item THEN the system SHALL delete it permanently
3. WHEN a swipe action is performed THEN the system SHALL update the UI immediately
4. WHEN a todo is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove it from local storage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize app settings like dark mode so that I can personalize my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL display available configuration options
2. WHEN I toggle dark mode THEN the system SHALL apply the theme change immediately
3. WHEN I change settings THEN the system SHALL persist preferences using DataStore
4. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app to have a modular architecture so that it's maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use Hilt for dependency injection
3. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL use Repository pattern with Room database
4. WHEN UI is built THEN the system SHALL use Jetpack Compose with MVVM architecture

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests so that I can ensure code quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are tested THEN the system SHALL include DAO unit tests with in-memory database
2. WHEN business logic is tested THEN the system SHALL include ViewModel tests with mock repositories
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide reliable and repeatable results
4. WHEN code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve reasonable coverage of critical paths

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline and sync in the background so that my data is always available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is used offline THEN the system SHALL provide full CRUD functionality
2. WHEN background sync runs THEN the system SHALL use WorkManager with 15-minute intervals
3. WHEN network is available THEN the system SHALL attempt background synchronization
4. WHEN data changes locally THEN the system SHALL reflect updates immediately in the UI
